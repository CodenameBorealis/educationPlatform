# Educational Platform
This is a project dedicated to developing a functional prototype of an online educational platform where you can study, do homework, view an on-site library of information about various topics and most importantly the ability to have online classes (Im not sure if I can do that tho lmao)

This project is being made solely for portfolio and learning of python's Django library and it's REST framework, additionally gaining skills in frontend development.

To run the server follow these steps:
1. Fetch or clone the repository using `git fetch` or `git clone` respectively.
2. Install python 3.12 if you haven't already.
3. Install virtualenv using `pip install virtualenv`.
4. Create a local enviroment using `virtualenv "./.venvs"`
5. Enter the virtual enviroment using `.venvs/Scripts/activate`
6. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
7. Finally to run a development server use `python eduPlatform/manage.py runserver`
