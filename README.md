# Project: EDUCATE // EduPlatfrom

This is a project dedicated to developing a functional prototype of an online educational platform where you can study, do homework, view an on-site library of information about various topics and most importantly the ability to have online classes (Im not sure if I can do that tho lmao)

This project is being made solely for portfolio and learning of python's Django library and it's REST framework, databases, real time communication and cyber security.
