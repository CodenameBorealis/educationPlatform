# Project: EDUCATE // EduPlatfrom

This is a project dedicated to developing a functional prototype of an online educational platform where people have the ability to host conferences and etc.
This project is being made solely for portfolio and learning of python's Django library and it's REST framework, databases, real time communication and etc.

Codestack for this project includes:
 - Backend: Django as the backend framework, MySQL as a database, Redis as a real-time database for conferences and celery, docker compose and dockerfile for deployment.
 - Frontend: No frameworks were used for this one due to the complexity of this project and my lack of knowledge of React.js. So this one goes as vanilla JS, css and HTML.
