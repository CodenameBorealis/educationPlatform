# EduPlatform / Frontend (React)

**Note:** to run the development server for react you need to have Node.js installed!

To run the server:
1. Go into the frontend folder `cd frontend`
2. Use `npm run dev` to run the server.

**!! Warning !!**
In order to get the frontend working you must have the backend server running as well for API's and static files.

To compile and build the project for production use `npm run build`
